# CAD Files
**These files are all work in progress as of the latest commit. Known issues are noted under each file.**

The final versions of these parts are all intended to be either printed using an MJF process or laser cut/machined. Notes on test print parameters are below.

## 701C Keyboard Cover + Stiffener
New model of the keyboard cover and associated stiffener plate. This is not a required part if the original is intact.
The stiffener is laser cut from 1mm stainless sheet.
**The LED diffuser may not fit and compatability with a stock 701C has not been tested.**
## Bottom Case
Test prints performed using a 0.25mm nozzle.
## Display Panel Adapter
Machined from 0.125" acetal (eg. Delrin). Currently missing mounting holes for the adapter PCB.
Could likely be printed with no issue.
## eDP Cable Retainer
Test prints performed using a 0.25mm nozzle.
## eDP Hinge Guide
Test prints performed using both a 0.25mm and 0.6mm nozzle. Both were acceptable.
## KB-Mouse Interface Spacer
Test prints performed using both a 0.25mm and 0.6mm nozzle. Both were acceptable.
## Power Button Spacer
Test prints performed using a 0.25mm nozzle.
## Power Button
Test prints performed using a 0.25mm nozzle. The final version will likely be machined aluminum or stainless.
## USB Hub Spacer
Test prints performed using both a 0.25mm and 0.6mm nozzle. Both were acceptable.
